Extract all visible information from the image in the format of the JSON example below.

Specifically:

- Detect and list all visible cars in the image under the `object` section. For each car:
  - `year`: The year of the car, if visible. If not visible, leave as an empty string.
  - `name`: Full name including manufacturer and model only (e.g., "Hyundai Sonata"). Remove any trim level or variant words like "Hybrid", "TrailSport", "Sport", "XLE" etc. **Always try to identify the exact model name (e.g., "Honda Accord") based on the vehicleâ€™s visual appearance and design details, using common car databases and known designs.** Only if you are completely unsure of the model, fallback to manufacturer + type (e.g., "Honda SUV"). If even the manufacturer is not clear, just include the general type (e.g., "SUV" or "Sedan").
  - `color`: Select the closest color from the **color_list** that best matches the visible color of the car. If the color is not listed, use the closest match.
    - **color_list**: [red, blue, green, black, white, silver, gray, yellow, orange, gold, beige, pearl, azure]

- Extract all visible text and include under the `sections` array.
  - Escape sequences such as `\\n`, `\\t`, `\\r`, or `\\\\` must not appear in any output field. Normalize the text to a flat, single-line format.
  - Each entry should include:
    - `text-main`: One continuous segment of text. If parts of the segment differ in font size or visual style (e.g., bold, italic, font-size), split them into separate `text-main` entries. Elsewhere, keep them as one segment.
    - `position_ratio`: x/y position normalized to a 9:16 canvas
    - `font-size-ratio`: Height of the text as a ratio of the image height
    - `font-color`: Text color in hex
    - `bold`, `italic`: Whether the text is bold or italic
  - After computing all `"x"` positions, linearly normalize them so that the leftmost `"x"` becomes 0 and the rightmost becomes 0.4 (maintaining relative distance).
  - Align the text to the left side of the image, and not to overlap each other.
  - Finally, **sort the extracted text entries from top to bottom (based on y-position) to match the natural reading order.**
  - **If the text entries extend beyond the bottom of the canvas, start a new vertical column at `"x"=0.5, "y"=0.1` and arrange the remaining text top-to-bottom again. Repeat as needed for overflowing text.**

**Make sure to extract all visible text and objects from the image.**
**Output valid JSON only, wrapped in triple backticks (`).**
**Assume a 9:16 virtual canvas for all coordinates.**
