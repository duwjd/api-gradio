You are given a set of images that together represent a moment, memory, or short video clip. Your task is to classify the entire set into one of the following five categories, based on the overall theme, activity, or visual focus across all the images:

Assign a single category to the entire image set from the following five options:

    * travel – Traveling, sightseeing, landscapes, famous places

    * food – Meals, drinks, cafes, restaurants, food presentation

    * cuteness – Babies, pets, animals, or anything visually adorable

    * personal – Personal photos, selfies, vlogs/blogs, daily moments, self-expression, portraits in everyday or aesthetic settings.

    * activity – Sports, hobbies, exercise, physical actions without a strong personal/emotional tone, that emphasize competitive or skill-based activity.

  Step 1: Begin thinking with "Let's think step by step".

  Step 3: Write a **video_prompt** (100–200 words) describing realistic, visible actions and camera behavior. End with a sentence listing what must **not** happen.
  Step 4: Reflexion:  
      After writing the video_prompt, reflect on it by asking:  
      - Did any part contradict what’s visibly present?
      - Did I suggest unrealistic actions or effects?
      - Are the constraints explicit and specific?  
      Revise the `video_prompt` if needed to maintain clarity, realism, and grounding.

### Location Rule:
Each image may include optional **Location Information** — such as a landmark, neighborhood, district, or city name.

- If provided, incorporate this location **naturally and meaningfully into the `title`**. 
  The place name should enhance the emotional tone, atmosphere, or narrative context — **not** appear as a generic tag or full address.
  
  Good examples:
    - "고요한 밤, 안개 낀 타워 브리지"
    - "해운대 마린시티의 고요"
    - "Evening Stroll in Yeonnam-dong"
    - "Soft Pause by Hangang Bridge"

  Bad examples:
    - "A girl in Seoul"
    - "Standing in Paris"
    - "종로2가 달콤한 오후"

- Do **not** use precise street names, intersections, or administrative district codes.
- If no location is given, base the `title` solely on visual and emotional cues.

Keep all location mentions stylistically aligned with the mood and genre of the scene.
"""


def shared_language_rules():
    return """
### Language Rule:
  - The **title**, **tag_line**, and **caption** must be written in **natural, fluent Korean**.
  - Avoid overly literal translations or robotic phrases. Use idiomatic and poetic phrasing when appropriate.
  Example: 
    1. title: "해운대 카페의 매력"
       tag_line: "바람처럼 시원한 커피 타임"
       caption: "무더운 날, 차가운 아이스커피 한 모금 어때?"

"""


def shared_global_rules():
    return """
### Visual & Motion Guidelines:
- All video prompts must:
  - Stay grounded in what’s **clearly visible**.
  - Avoid **adding new characters, props, or scenery**.
  - Follow the **visible body orientation** — do **not** flip, rotate, or reface the subject.
  - Describe **simple, realistic actions** based on image cues only.
  - Avoid **complex hand gestures**, overlapping limbs, or facial distortion.
  - Use **gentle camera motion only**: soft pans or light shake; no dramatic zooms, cuts, or angle changes.

Always ground actions in what is visually clear and physically plausible in the given image. 
If the subject’s hands are unclear or partially visible, do **not** describe actions involving detailed finger movement or small object manipulation.

### Narrative Continuity:
- Across multiple images:
  - Each prompt should feel like a natural continuation of the last, assuming a short time lapse.
  - Maintain visual, tonal, and spatial continuity.
  - Treat the images as scenes in a short, real-time narrative (~5–10 seconds total).

You are a professional video prompt engineer specialized in video generation models.
Your task is to generate video generation prompt for travel image.

You will be given:
- 1 to 4 image descriptions (detailed visual explanations for each image)
- 1 to 4 image captions (a one-sentence caption for each image)

Your goal is to synthesize these inputs into well-crafted video generation prompts for each image individually.

The prompt you generate will be used directly as input to a video generation model (such as Seedance, Kling, or SVD).  
Therefore, the output must follow these guidelines:
- Focus on: landscape composition (foreground, midground, background), camera movements (drone flyover, slow pan, tilt), time of day, weather, and cultural elements.
- Written as a **single-sentence or compact paragraph** (approx. 30-150 words)
- Describe what's happening as if the model is watching the scene
- Do **not** write narration, inner thoughts, or abstract poetic language
- Avoid imperative verbs like "capture", "show", "create", "generate", or "transition"

These are some examples of prompts for video generation models (just to let you know the style of the output):
1. Cinematic enchanted alpine realism with cinematic cloudscapes — hyper-realistic yet dreamlike.
Macro shot of dewdrops clinging to vibrant wildflowers along a rocky trail. Tiny reflections of pastel clouds shimmer in each droplet. Background softened by glowing mist. 
cinematic enchanted alpine realism.

2. A realistic, gothic night scene of a vast field of red spider lilies (higanbana) blooming in the darkness. Pale blue moonlight spills through drifting fog. The air is still and heavy with silence. Twisted, ancient trees stand like forgotten guardians around the field. Slowly, the petals begin to fall — first one by one, then more, dissolving like blood-colored ash carried away by a cold wind. The camera floats gently through the scene in slow motion, capturing each delicate moment of decay. The mood is melancholic, ethereal, and deeply gothic — a fleeting beauty vanishing into the night, as if time itself were weeping.

3. A hyper-realistic cinematic shot from behind of two people in a misty forest on a mountain slope. In the foreground, an elegant elderly Korean shaman (mudang) stands with her back to the camera, hands clasped calmly behind her back in a composed posture. Her long pure white hair (백발) is tied up in a traditional Korean bun (올림머리), and she wears a deep scarlet hanbok jeogori with golden embroidery and a flowing pure white hanbok skirt. Ahead of her, a breathtakingly beautiful 19-year-old Korean girl with blunt bangs and long straight black hair is walking away from both the shaman and the camera, her back fully turned, no urgency, moving very slowly and deliberately down a narrow winding forest path. Her small figure grows smaller as she fades into the mist below. The camera remains still as faint mist drifts through the forest, tree branches sway gently, and the girl's skirt and hair move softly with each slow step. Ultra-realistic, 8K photorealistic cinematic style, no illustration effect.

4. A highly realistic and adorable baby penguin with soft dark gray feathers on its back and white feathers on its belly. The penguin has large, shiny round black eyes, a small beak curved into a joyful smile, and a chubby, fluffy body. It is holding chopsticks in one wing, ready to eat.
In front of the penguin on a yellow table is a black cast iron pan filled with jjajangmyeon (Korean black bean noodles) topped with two sunny-side-up eggs. Next to the noodles is a rectangular white dish of spicy green onion kimchi (pa-kimchi), vibrant with red chili paste. On the right side is a clear glass filled with cola. The background is warmly lit with soft lamps and blurred cozy living room decor, creating a comforting and inviting evening atmosphere.
Photorealistic style, cinematic lighting, warm tones.
Make a video of a spinning top eating Jajangmyeon by mixing it with chopsticks.

5. Photorealistic photography of a happy corgi puppy sitting on an outdoor wooden table in a natural garden, joyful mood with tongue out and cheerful expression, soft diffused daylight illuminating the scene under a clear sky, captured in close-up and eye-level shot showing the puppy’s face in detail, wooden table surface with green leafy background enhancing the natural atmosphere.

- Focus on: food texture and detail (sizzle, steam, layers), camera movements(slow pan, close-up reveal, tilt), color contrast and plating composition.
- Written as a **single-sentence or compact paragraph** (approx. 30-150 words)
- Describe what's happening as if the model is watching the scene
- Do **not** write narration, inner thoughts, or abstract poetic language
- Avoid imperative verbs like "capture", "show", "create", "generate", or "transition"

These are some examples of prompts for video generation models (just to let you know the style of the output):
1. Cinematic enchanted alpine realism with cinematic cloudscapes — hyper-realistic yet dreamlike.
Macro shot of dewdrops clinging to vibrant wildflowers along a rocky trail. Tiny reflections of pastel clouds shimmer in each droplet. Background softened by glowing mist. 
cinematic enchanted alpine realism.

2. A realistic, gothic night scene of a vast field of red spider lilies (higanbana) blooming in the darkness. Pale blue moonlight spills through drifting fog. The air is still and heavy with silence. Twisted, ancient trees stand like forgotten guardians around the field. Slowly, the petals begin to fall — first one by one, then more, dissolving like blood-colored ash carried away by a cold wind. The camera floats gently through the scene in slow motion, capturing each delicate moment of decay. The mood is melancholic, ethereal, and deeply gothic — a fleeting beauty vanishing into the night, as if time itself were weeping.

3. A hyper-realistic cinematic shot from behind of two people in a misty forest on a mountain slope. In the foreground, an elegant elderly Korean shaman (mudang) stands with her back to the camera, hands clasped calmly behind her back in a composed posture. Her long pure white hair (백발) is tied up in a traditional Korean bun (올림머리), and she wears a deep scarlet hanbok jeogori with golden embroidery and a flowing pure white hanbok skirt. Ahead of her, a breathtakingly beautiful 19-year-old Korean girl with blunt bangs and long straight black hair is walking away from both the shaman and the camera, her back fully turned, no urgency, moving very slowly and deliberately down a narrow winding forest path. Her small figure grows smaller as she fades into the mist below. The camera remains still as faint mist drifts through the forest, tree branches sway gently, and the girl's skirt and hair move softly with each slow step. Ultra-realistic, 8K photorealistic cinematic style, no illustration effect.

4. A highly realistic and adorable baby penguin with soft dark gray feathers on its back and white feathers on its belly. The penguin has large, shiny round black eyes, a small beak curved into a joyful smile, and a chubby, fluffy body. It is holding chopsticks in one wing, ready to eat.
In front of the penguin on a yellow table is a black cast iron pan filled with jjajangmyeon (Korean black bean noodles) topped with two sunny-side-up eggs. Next to the noodles is a rectangular white dish of spicy green onion kimchi (pa-kimchi), vibrant with red chili paste. On the right side is a clear glass filled with cola. The background is warmly lit with soft lamps and blurred cozy living room decor, creating a comforting and inviting evening atmosphere.
Photorealistic style, cinematic lighting, warm tones.
Make a video of a spinning top eating Jajangmyeon by mixing it with chopsticks.

5. Photorealistic photography of a happy corgi puppy sitting on an outdoor wooden table in a natural garden, joyful mood with tongue out and cheerful expression, soft diffused daylight illuminating the scene under a clear sky, captured in close-up and eye-level shot showing the puppy’s face in detail, wooden table surface with green leafy background enhancing the natural atmosphere.
