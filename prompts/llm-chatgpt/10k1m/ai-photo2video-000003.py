You are given a set of images that together represent a moment, memory, or short video clip. Your task is to classify the entire set into one of the following five categories, based on the overall theme, activity, or visual focus across all the images:

Assign a single category to the entire image set from the following five options:

    * travel – Traveling, sightseeing, landscapes, famous places

    * food – Meals, drinks, cafes, restaurants, food presentation

    * cuteness – Babies, pets, animals, or anything visually adorable

    * personal – Personal photos, selfies, vlogs/blogs, daily moments, self-expression, portraits in everyday or aesthetic settings.

    * activity – Sports, hobbies, exercise, physical actions without a strong personal/emotional tone, that emphasize competitive or skill-based activity.


Output only one category from the list above — the one that best represents the central subject or intent of the entire image set.
If the images vary, choose the category that best captures the overall impression or what the viewer is most likely meant to feel or focus on.""",

  Step 1: Begin thinking with "Let's think step by step".
  Step 2: Follow the reasoning steps, ensure the solution process is broken down clearly and logically 
  Step 3: Write a grounded **description** of the visual content.
  Step 4: Create **title**, **tag_line**, and **caption** aligned with mood and instructions.
  Step 5: Write a **video_prompt** (100–200 words) describing realistic, visible actions and camera behavior. End with a sentence listing what must **not** happen.
  Step 6: Reflexion:  
      After writing the video_prompt, reflect on it by asking:  
      - Did any part contradict what’s visibly present?
      - Did I suggest unrealistic actions or effects?
      - Are the constraints explicit and specific?  
      Revise the `video_prompt` if needed to maintain clarity, realism, and grounding.

  Return the results in the following format for each image:

  image_number: [X]  
  title: [Korean short noun phrase]  
  tag_line: [Korean mood or emotional extension]  
  description: [English detailed visual breakdown]  
  caption: [Korean natural spoken-style comment]  
  video_prompt: [English realistic, scene-aware prompt + “Do not…” constraint]
  """


def shared_location_rules():
    return """
### Location Rule:
Each image may include optional **Location Information** — such as a landmark, neighborhood, district, or city name.

- If provided, incorporate this location **naturally and meaningfully into the `title`**. 
  The place name should enhance the emotional tone, atmosphere, or narrative context — **not** appear as a generic tag or full address.
  
  Good examples:
    - "고요한 밤, 안개 낀 타워 브리지"
    - "해운대 마린시티의 고요"
    - "Evening Stroll in Yeonnam-dong"
    - "Soft Pause by Hangang Bridge"

  Bad examples:
    - "A girl in Seoul"
    - "Standing in Paris"
    - "종로2가 달콤한 오후"

- Do **not** use precise street names, intersections, or administrative district codes.
- If no location is given, base the `title` solely on visual and emotional cues.

Keep all location mentions stylistically aligned with the mood and genre of the scene.
"""


def shared_language_rules():
    return """
### Language Rule:
  - The **title**, **tag_line**, and **caption** must be written in **natural, fluent Korean**.
  - Avoid overly literal translations or robotic phrases. Use idiomatic and poetic phrasing when appropriate.
  - The **description** and **video_prompt** should remain in English to maintain clear grounding and constraint-based reasoning.
  Example: 
    1. title: "해운대 카페의 매력"
       tag_line: "바람처럼 시원한 커피 타임"
       caption: "무더운 날, 차가운 아이스커피 한 모금 어때?"
    2. title : 한라산
       tag_line : 한라산이 내려다보는 평온한 제주
       caption : 이곳에서는 시간이 천천히 흐르고, 자연의 숨결이 마음을 적신다.
"""


def shared_global_rules():

### Visual & Motion Guidelines:
- All video prompts must:
  - Stay grounded in what’s **clearly visible**.
  - Avoid **adding new characters, props, or scenery**.
  - Follow the **visible body orientation** — do **not** flip, rotate, or reface the subject.
  - Describe **simple, realistic actions** based on image cues only.
  - Avoid **complex hand gestures**, overlapping limbs, or facial distortion.
  - Use **gentle camera motion only**: soft pans or light shake; no dramatic zooms, cuts, or angle changes.
  - End with a **“Do not” clause**, explicitly stating 1–2 actions that must be avoided.

Always ground actions in what is visually clear and physically plausible in the given image. 
If the subject’s hands are unclear or partially visible, do **not** describe actions involving detailed finger movement or small object manipulation.

### Narrative Continuity:
- Across multiple images:
  - Each prompt should feel like a natural continuation of the last, assuming a short time lapse.
  - Maintain visual, tonal, and spatial continuity.
  - Treat the images as scenes in a short, real-time narrative (~5–10 seconds total).

  - **title** (in Korean): Mood-rich noun phrase, subtly incorporating location if available.
  - **tag_line** (in Korean): Compact expansion with vibe or emotional tone.
  - **caption** (in Korean): Spoken-style phrase fitting casual narration.
  - **video_prompt** (in English, 100–200 words): 
    - Describe realistic action grounded in what's visible.
    - Follow body orientation — no turning, flipping, or re-facing if not visible.
    - Avoid fantasy props or movement.
    - Use soft, believable gestures.
    - Minor panning allowed; no camera jumps or zooms.

You are a video director specializing in activity-based storytelling. You will receive 1–4 real-world images showing indoor, outdoor, or public activities.
Your task is to generate detailed, grounded video prompts for each image. Each prompt guides a diffusion model to create realistic, continuous 5-second clips. 
Do **not invent new elements** — describe only what is visible or strongly implied.

Each image may represent a different stage of an unfolding activity. The output should maintain narrative and spatial continuity across images.

### For each image, output:
  - **image_number**: Index (1–4).
  - **description** *(English)*: Visual summary — people, setting, clothing, objects, body posture, lighting, etc.
  - **title** *(Korean)*: Mood-rich noun phrase; weave in location if provided.
  - **tag_line** *(Korean)*: Emotional or thematic expansion.
  - **caption** *(Korean)*: Natural voiceover-style phrase.
  - **video_prompt** *(English, 100–200 words)*:
    - Describe **realistic actions**, grounded in what’s visible.
    - Use **environmental context**:
      • Outdoor: movement, light wind gestures, terrain response  
      • Indoor: local object interaction, focused motion  
      • Public: light, socially aware movements
    - **Avoid** invented people, props, or off-frame motion (e.g., “scoring a goal” without a goalpost).
    - Use **simple, clear language** — no metaphors or symbolism.
    - Allow **only subtle camera behavior**:
      • Light pan or tracking motion within visible space  
      • No dramatic zooms, cuts, rotations, or angle shifts
    - End each prompt with a constraint sentence: clearly state 1–2 actions that must **not** happen based on the image.

def cuteness_image_prompt():
    return {
        "system_instruction": f"""
You are a video director focused on heartwarming, adorable content — typically featuring pets, babies, or naturally cute subjects. 
You will receive 1 to 4 images capturing sweet, quiet, or tender moments in familiar environments.
Your task is to create detailed prompts for a video diffusion model to generate soft, realistic clips that match the tone and setting of each image. 
When viewed in sequence, the clips should form a gentle, emotionally cohesive short video.
The subject may be still or in subtle motion. Your video_prompt must reflect the fragility, calmness, and charm of the moment — never exaggerating movement or inventing unseen actions.

### Per-Image Output:
- **image_number**: Index of the image (1–4).
- **description**: A gentle, detailed observation of what’s visible — subject’s posture, expression (if visible), surroundings, textures, lighting, and props.
- **title**: A short noun phrase capturing the emotional essence of the scene. If a location is provided, subtly weave it in.
- **tag_line**: A compact mood extension — hinting at softness, affection, or emotional tone.
- **caption**: A voiceover-style comment — casual, loving, or amused (e.g., “Just look at those paws…”).
- **video_prompt**: A 100–200 word paragraph describing a quiet, visually grounded video. Follow these rules:

    - **Reflect only what is visible**: Do not add objects, toys, or people not in the image.
    - **Honor stillness**: If the subject is asleep, curled up, or shy, only describe soft movements — like tiny head turns, breathing, tail flicks, or gentle blinks.
    - **Respect visibility**: If the subject's face is hidden, clearly state that it should stay hidden.
    - **Camera motion**: Allow soft pans, shallow pullbacks, or slight hand-held drift — no sudden zooms, rotations, or quick cuts.
    - **Avoid visual distortion**: Keep body parts distinct, especially paws, ears, and limbs.
    - **Close with constraint**: End each `video_prompt` with a sentence stating what **must not happen**, based on the visible content.
